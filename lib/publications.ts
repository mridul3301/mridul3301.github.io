    journal: "Arxiv Pre-print",
    year: 2025,
    type: "preprint",
    tags: ["Scalable Oversight", "NLP", "Language Models", "evaluations"],
    abstract: 
      "We conducted two studies examining the performance of simple oversight protocols where evaluators know that the model is correct most of the time, but not all of the time.",

    title: "Consolidating and Developing Benchmarking Datasets for the Nepali Natural Language Understanding Tasks",
    authors: "Nyachhyon J, Sharma M, Thapa P, Bal BK",
    journal: "Arxiv Pre-print",
    year: 2025,
    type: "preprint",
    tags: ["NLP", "Benchmarking", "Language Understanding", "evaluations"],
    abstract:
      "We introduce twelvw new datasets, creating a new benchmark, the Nepali Language Understanding Evaluation (NLUE) benchmark, for evaluating the performance of models across a diverse set of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. The added tasks include single-sentence classification, similarity and paraphrase tasks, and Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks. On evaluating the models using added tasks, we observe that the existing models fall short in handling complex NLU tasks effectively.",
